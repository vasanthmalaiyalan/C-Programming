Rules of Contruction Variable Names :

A  variable name is any combination of 1 to 31 alphabets,digits or underscores. 

Some compilers allow variable names 
whose length could be up to 247 characters.
Still, it would be safer to stick to the rule of 31 characters. 

Do not create 
unnecessarily long variable names as it adds to your typing effort. 

No commas or blanks are allowed within a variable name. 
No special symbol other than an underscore (as in gross_sal) 
can be used in a variable name. 
Ex.:   si_int 
  m_hra 
  pop_e_89 



  The general form of printf( ) function is, 
printf ( "<format string>", <list of variables> ) ; 
<format string> can contain, 
%f  for printing real values 
%d  for printing integer values 
%c  for printing character values
